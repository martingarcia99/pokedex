The Pokedex is a project that displays all Pokémon and their characteristics. It includes a search feature to easily locate any Pokémon and a favorites section to quickly access those you like the most. This project is built using React, TailwindCSS, and Webpack, with external API calls to retrieve detailed Pokémon information. The goal is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploring the Pokémon universe.
